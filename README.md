# Duplicate-questions-pair

In this Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, I aim to build a model that can identify and detect duplicate question pairs from a given dataset. I used the Quora Question Pairs dataset, which contains pairs of questions asked on the Quora platform. Duplicate question pairs are a common occurrence in various question-answering platforms and forums, leading to redundant information and inefficiency in user interactions.
